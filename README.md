# Responsive Portfolio

As my second homework assignment, I was assigned the task of creating a responsive portfolio based on wireframes from specific breakpoints. The bulk of this was done utilizing Bootstrap frameworks that were then modifided through css to fit my needs. The website was required to have three pages: an about me page with a headshot, a portfolio with placeholders, and a mock contact form. 

I was challenged to use concepts that we had learned in lecture including Bootstrap grids and media queries in order to achieve the responsive aspects. Responsivity is crucial in today's web development as we are rapidly adding new and varying screen sizes that users could access a website from. Responsive design ensures that regardless of web application or screen size, the content will render well and be user friendly.
